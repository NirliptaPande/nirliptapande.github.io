Sunsets are my favorite part of the day, because I can find an example where endings are beautiful and because they are more accessible than sunrises :p It often doesn't matter how nervewrecking my day was, walking back from the office watching the sunlight bounce off the trees, makes me grateful for being here, and keeps me hopeful. After a difficult day, I look into the sunset and listen to [130+ nerdfighters singing We're here because we're here because we're here because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVfqbnz96kk)... I don't feel alone anymore after this.

Your art piece was made with a lot of hope, for days you might feel alone. And it was made in watercolors and gouache.
