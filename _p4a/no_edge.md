"Mysterium tremendum et fascinans-- that stomach- flipping mix of awestruck fear and entrancing fascination."- John Green in An Abundance of Katherines

"DUDE.... NO EDGE..."- Hank

I think that's pretty much how I feel about painting this, in excited moments, I share the [excitement of Hank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0ul881nhXE) and in more sombre moments, I am [fascinated and terrified at the same time, like John](https://nerdfighteria.info/v/505878375/).

Your art piece is made in watercolors and ink with the same fascination in mind.
