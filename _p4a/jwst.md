I was so excited to follow JWST, it is proof of science being meticulous and the images it captured were absolutely enthralling. Nerdfighteria being more excited about it inspired this art piece which I had such an enjoyable time creating. JWST is a reminder of our curiosity to understand the world around us, and the vastness of it and our very short temporal range as humans.

This art piece was created only using watercolors, and there are six unique pieces that I created for P4A. The image has 19 hexagons as opposed to the 18 mirrors in the JWST, as it created more harmony in the image as opposed to an empty detector.

You can watch Hank excitedly talking about JWST [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihpNNBmJypE) 13 years ago, and more recently and less excitedly, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf4EDcjMtmw)
