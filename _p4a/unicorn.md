This is my favorite art theme so far, not just because I finally got to take a stand against John's proposition of Unicorns being evil, but also because painting on gold and silver leaves is so mesmerizing. You can find John's unfounded argument [here](https://youtu.be/VLWNXlVcVPM?si=SNeB45Q7m5jk_K13&t=80) and [here](https://youtu.be/avhOcKHWb-Y?si=PU_jRsdnEU0LymYq&t=102). I reinterate, unicorns are not evil, I don't have the vocabulary or the peruasiveness of an author who has sold 50 million prints of his books, but I am willing to fight the innocence of unicorns. It is outrageous to blame unicorns for Voldemort's resurrection in Harry Potter.

I had a lot of fun making this art piece which is made on handmade paper covered in gold/silver leaves and the sketch is made in gouache and inks. 

PS: If you are Team Zombies, you might find some respite in the novella, [Zombiecorns](https://www.goodreads.com/series/86491-zombicorns), which unfortunately doesn't involve any Unicorns...
