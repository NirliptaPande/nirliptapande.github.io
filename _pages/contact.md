Hi, I am Nirlipta, a researcher in Computer Science. My research interests include understanding causal structures and representations under AI models, and developing models with causal reasoning capabilities.  
Apart from research, I love painting and reading.
Feel free to contact me to talk about research, or painting via email: [nirliptapande@gmail.com](mailto:nirliptapande@protonmail.com)
