## <ins>Zombies vs. Unicorns</ins>

[Zombies v. Unicorns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avhOcKHWb-Y)  
Wow, It's been 16 years since this video was put on vlogbrothers.  
I hope you like my painting of unicorns, described by John as: "the worst part of horses plus the worst part of rhinocerous".  
Well, I have to admit, I am on John's side when choosing between Zombies and Unicorns.  
13 years ago, John went on to write a book titled [Zombicorns](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10268370), which (again in the words of John himself), is "steaming mess of prose". Go ahead, read that novella (Disclaimer: The book is not about unicorns)
