Wow, It's been 16 years since this video was put on vlogbrothers.  
I hope you like my painting of unicorns, described by John as: "the worst part of horses plus the worst part of rhinocerous".  
Well, these paintings are my way to retorting to John. I am on Hank's side when choosing between Zombies and Unicorns. #TeamUnicorns  
13 years ago, John went on to write a book titled [Zombicorns](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10268370), which (again in the words of John himself), is "steaming mess of prose". Go ahead, read that novella (Disclaimer: The book is not about unicorns)
