Hi, thank you for contributing to decreasing world suck. Your perk is an original artpiece made my me, in gouache, inks and watercolors accompanied by a handmade bracelet. I hope it finds a new home in your place and your heart. You can find the broader theme of the art work below and how it came to be.
